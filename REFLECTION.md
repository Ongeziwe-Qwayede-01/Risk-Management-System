## Challenges Faced in Balancing Stakeholder Needs  

- **Security vs Usability**  
  Security teams required strict access controls to protect sensitive data, but employees preferred a simple, user-friendly interface for reporting risks.  

- **Real-Time Data vs Performance**  
  Executives needed up-to-date risk metrics, but frequent data updates put strain on system performance.  

- **Compliance vs Flexibility**  
  Compliance officers insisted on strict policy enforcement, while administrators needed the ability to customize workflows to fit their organization's needs.  

- **Scalability Concerns**  
  The system needed to handle large enterprises with thousands of users while remaining affordable and efficient for smaller organizations.  

To address these challenges, the team prioritized stakeholder concerns, gathered iterative feedback, and made trade-offs to create a balanced and effective solution.
