## **Non-Functional Test Cases**

| **Test Case ID** | **Requirement ID** | **Description** | **Test Scenario** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result** | **Status (Pass/Fail)** |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| TC-009 | NFR-001 | Performance Testing | Simulate 1,000 concurrent users submitting risks | System should handle requests without crashing, and response time should be â‰¤ 2 seconds | | |
| TC-010 | NFR-002 | Security Testing | Attempt unauthorized access to modify risk data | System should prevent unauthorized access and log the attempt | | |
