# Reflection – Assignment 8: UML Diagram Modeling

This reflection outlines the key challenges and insights from modeling **state transition diagrams** and **activity diagrams** for the Risk Management System (RMS), aligning with Agile methodology and system design goals.


##  Challenge 1: Choosing Granularity for States and Actions

A major challenge was determining the appropriate **granularity** for modeling system behaviors:

- **Too much detail** made diagrams overwhelming and difficult to interpret.
- **Too little detail** risked omitting critical system logic.

To balance this, we focused on **core business actions** and **decision points**, ensuring diagrams were both concise and informative.

## Challenge 2: Aligning Diagrams with Agile User Stories

Agile development encourages **iterative design and evolving requirements**, which complicated diagram creation:

- Diagrams needed to be flexible and adaptable to **changing user stories** and **sprint tasks**.
- Each diagram was mapped directly to **functional requirements** and **user stories**, improving traceability and alignment with project goals.

## Comparison: State Diagrams vs Activity Diagrams

| Diagram Type      | Purpose                     | Strength                            | Example Scenario                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **State Diagrams** | Model object state changes  | Ideal for tracking **object lifecycles** | Risk Status transitions (e.g., Open → Reviewed → Closed) |
| **Activity Diagrams** | Represent process workflows | Great for visualizing **end-to-end system processes** | Mitigation Plan Submission and Approval Flow |

This assignment highlighted the **complementary strengths** of each UML type. While state diagrams excel at modeling internal transitions of individual components, activity diagrams clearly show the full scope of user and system interactions.
