üß† Reflection ‚Äì Assignment 8: UML Diagram Modeling
This reflection discusses the challenges and learning outcomes from designing state transition diagrams and activity diagrams for the Risk Management System (RMS) in alignment with Agile principles.

‚öñÔ∏è Challenge 1: Choosing Granularity for States and Actions
One of the key difficulties was finding the right level of detail for each diagram.

Too much detail made diagrams cluttered and difficult to follow.

Too little detail failed to communicate essential system behavior.

We overcame this by focusing only on business-relevant actions and decision points, maintaining a clear, readable flow while supporting system requirements.

üîÑ Challenge 2: Aligning Diagrams with Agile User Stories
Agile development introduces frequent iteration and evolving requirements, which made it challenging to lock down stable diagram states.

Diagrams had to remain flexible to match changes in user stories and sprint tasks.

We traced each diagram back to specific functional requirements and user stories, improving clarity and ensuring traceability.

üîç Comparison: State Diagrams vs Activity Diagrams
Type	Purpose	Strength	Example
State Diagrams	Show how an object changes over time	Good for modeling object lifecycles	Status of a Risk Item (e.g., Open ‚Üí Mitigated ‚Üí Closed)
Activity Diagrams	Model business workflows	Ideal for showing process flow	Submitting and Approving a Mitigation Plan
This assignment emphasized the complementary nature of these diagrams ‚Äî activity diagrams were useful for end-to-end interactions, while state diagrams helped model internal object behavior.
