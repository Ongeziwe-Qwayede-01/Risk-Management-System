# Kanban Board Explanation

## What is a Kanban Board?
A Kanban board is a visual project management tool used to track tasks through different stages of work. It helps teams manage workflows efficiently by organizing tasks into columns that represent their progress.

## How Our Kanban Board Works
- **Visualizing Workflow:**  
  Our board consists of six columns:  
  - **To Do** – New tasks that need to be started.  
  - **In Progress** – Tasks actively being worked on.  
  - **In Review** – Tasks pending approval or feedback.  
  - **Testing** – Tasks undergoing quality assurance checks.  
  - **Blocked** – Tasks that cannot proceed due to issues.  
  - **Done** – Completed tasks.  

- **Limiting Work-In-Progress (WIP):**  
  We limit WIP to three tasks per column (except "Blocked" and "Done") to prevent overload and ensure focused progress.

- **Supporting Agile Principles:**  
  - Continuous delivery: Tasks move fluidly across the board with regular updates.  
  - Adaptability: If priorities change, tasks can be reassigned or moved accordingly.  
  - Transparency: The board provides real-time visibility into task status for all team members.
