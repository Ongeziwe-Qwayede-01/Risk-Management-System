## Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template  
One challenge was choosing a GitHub project template that best supports Agile workflows. While **Basic Kanban** is simple, it lacks automation. **Automated Kanban** was ideal because it auto-moves tasks based on status changes, reducing manual updates. However, customizing columns required manual effort.

## Comparing GitHub to Trello & Jira  
- **GitHub Projects** integrates well with repositories but has limited reporting features.  
- **Trello** is user-friendly and flexible but lacks deep integration with code repositories.  
- **Jira** offers powerful Agile tracking but can be complex for small teams.  

Ultimately, GitHubâ€™s **Automated Kanban** provided the right balance of automation and flexibility for our **Risk Management System**.
