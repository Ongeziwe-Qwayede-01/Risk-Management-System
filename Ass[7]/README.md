**Risk Management System - Kanban Board**
**Customization Choices**
To optimize our Agile workflow, we customized our GitHub Kanban board by adding additional columns beyond the default ones. Below is a breakdown of our choices:

**Added ‘Testing’ Column**
Purpose: Ensures all features and risk management processes are properly validated before being marked as "Done."

Example Issues:

Review Risk Reports (Validating accuracy of generated reports)

Generate Real-Time Alerts (Testing alert accuracy and notification delivery)

**Added ‘Blocked’ Column**
Purpose: Highlights tasks that are currently stuck due to dependencies, approvals, or technical challenges.

Example Issues:

Approve Mitigation Plans (Pending approval from compliance team)

Support 1,000 Concurrent Users (Blocked due to infrastructure scaling needs)

**Workflow Explanation**
To Do → Backlog of planned tasks.

In Progress → Tasks actively being worked on.

In Review → Tasks undergoing peer review or security checks.

Testing → Features being validated for accuracy and security.

Blocked → Tasks that cannot proceed due to external dependencies.

Done → Completed and verified tasks.
