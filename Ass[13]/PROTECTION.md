# Branch Protection Rules

Branch protection rules are important for enforcing collaboration, code quality, and CI/CD discipline.

## Rules Enabled for `main`:
- ✅ Require pull request review before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Disable direct pushes to `main`

## ✅ Why These Rules Matter:
- **Quality Assurance**: Prevents untested or broken code from entering the main branch.
- **Team Collaboration**: Enforces code reviews before merging.
- **Security**: Protects production code from accidental or unauthorized changes.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Ensures that only validated code is deployed.
