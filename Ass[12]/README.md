## Folder-by-Folder Overview
- `api/`: Exposes endpoint routes for risks, users, and mitigation plans.
- `services/`: Contains reusable business logic for all core modules.
- `repositories/`: Provides in-memory storage but can be extended to real DBs.
- `src/`: Defines `Risk`, `User`, and `MitigationPlan` models.
- `tests/`: Organized test files per service and route layer.
