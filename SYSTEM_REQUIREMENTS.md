# **System Requirements Document (SRD)**

This document defines the system requirements for the Risk Management System, ensuring it meets stakeholder needs. Below are the functional and non-functional requirements to guide development and implementation.

---

## **1. Functional Requirements**  
The system shall provide the following capabilities:  

1. The system shall allow users to log identified risks with details such as category, severity, and likelihood.  
2. The system shall allow users to update, delete, and track risks over time.  
3. The system shall provide automated risk assessment using predefined criteria.  
4. The system shall generate risk mitigation plans based on predefined templates.  
5. The system shall allow users to assign risks to responsible personnel.  
6. The system shall generate real-time risk assessment reports.  
7. The system shall send automated alerts for high-severity risks.  
8. The system shall integrate with third-party compliance tools.  
9. The system shall provide a dashboard for executives with key risk metrics.  
10. The system shall allow administrators to manage user roles and access permissions.  

### **Acceptance Criteria for Critical Requirements**  
- **Risk Logging:** A logged risk must include a category, severity level, and description.  
- **Risk Assessment Reports:** Reports must update dynamically based on new data.  
- **Alerts:** High-severity risks trigger email notifications within 5 minutes.

## **2. Non-Functional Requirements**  

### **Usability**  
- The interface shall be intuitive and provide guided steps for risk logging.  
- The system shall comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) accessibility standards.  

### **Deployability**  
- The system shall be deployable on cloud-based platforms like netlify.  

### **Maintainability**  
- The system’s codebase shall follow modular design principles for easier updates.  
- API documentation shall be maintained for future integrations.  

### **Scalability**  
- The system shall support up to 5,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.  
- The database shall be optimized to handle a minimum of 1 million risk records.  

### **Security**  
- All user data shall be encrypted using AES-256.  
- Users shall be required to authenticate via multi-factor authentication (MFA).  

### **Performance**  
- Risk search results shall be returned within 2 seconds.  
- System response time shall not exceed 3 seconds under peak load.

## **Conclusion**  
This document defines the system’s functional and non-functional requirements to ensure its usability, security, and efficiency. By meeting these requirements, the system will provide a reliable and scalable solution for managing risks effectively.
