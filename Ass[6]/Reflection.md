### Challenges in Prioritization  
One of the primary challenges was deciding the prioritization of user stories using the MoSCoW method. While some stories were clearly “Must-have” (such as risk identification and assessment), others fell into the “Should-have” or “Could-have” categories, making it difficult to rank them effectively. For example, role-based access control (RBAC) was critical for security but did not directly impact initial usability, placing it in the “Should-have” category rather than “Must-have.”  

Stakeholder perspective also played a crucial role in prioritization. Since I am currently the sole stakeholder, I had to evaluate features based on a logical assessment of the system’s core functionality. If real stakeholders were involved, their feedback might have altered some of the prioritization decisions.  

Another challenge was balancing technical and user-centric stories. Security and performance enhancements (such as data encryption and concurrent user handling) are crucial from a system perspective but might not immediately impact end users. These stories were categorized under “Must-have” or “Should-have” based on long-term business needs rather than immediate usability.  

### Difficulties in Estimating Effort  
Effort estimation using story points was another challenging aspect. Assigning values to each story required an understanding of development complexity, dependencies, and expected effort. The Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8) was useful in distinguishing tasks that seemed relatively easy from those requiring more significant effort.  

For example, implementing the backend API for risk assessment was assigned a story point value of 5 due to its complexity and dependencies. In contrast, linking risks to past incidents was assigned a lower value of 2, as it primarily involves retrieving and displaying existing data. However, without empirical data from past development cycles, there remains some uncertainty in these estimations. In a real-world Agile team, estimation would involve discussions with developers who have expertise in the domain.  

### Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs  
Agile methodologies emphasize delivering incremental value and maintaining flexibility in response to change. However, since I am the sole decision-maker at this stage, the iterative nature of Agile is not being fully leveraged. In a real project, constant feedback from end users, executives, and compliance officers would refine the backlog over time.  

Despite this limitation, breaking down the project into smaller user stories and sprints helped simulate the Agile approach. The sprint goal—focusing on risk identification, assessment, and approval—was chosen to ensure that stakeholders could see tangible progress early on. If this were a collaborative environment, user feedback would likely influence the scope of future sprints.  

### Key Takeaways  
This exercise showed the importance of structured planning in Agile development. Prioritization requires balancing usability, security, and technical feasibility. Effort estimation is not an exact science but provides valuable guidance in managing workloads. Finally, aligning Agile processes with stakeholder needs ensures that development remains user-driven and adaptable to changes.
