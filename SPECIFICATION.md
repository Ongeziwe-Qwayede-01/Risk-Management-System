System Specification Document
## Project Title
Risk Management System
## Domain
Risk Management in Organisations
# Introduction
Risk management is a critical function for organisations and businesses across various industries. They include finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and IT. Organizations constantly face potential threats, such as financial losses, security breaches, regulatory non-compliance, operational failures, and reputational damage. Without a structured approach in organisations to identifying and addressing these risks, businesses become vulnerable to unexpected disruptions that can impact growth and stability.

A Risk Management System provides organizations with a centralized platform to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks effectively. By leveraging technology, businesses can transition from reactive risk management to a proactive, data-driven approach. This system ensures that potential threats are recognized early, appropriate mitigation strategies are developed, and ongoing monitoring keeps risks under control.

The system will support organizations in:
-	Identifying risks across various departments and operations.
-	Assessing risks based on probability and potential impact.
-	Developing mitigation plans to minimize the consequences of risks.
-	Tracking risks over time and ensuring continuous monitoring.

## Problem Statement
Many organization faces risks like its financial losses, cyber security threats, compliance issues, or unexpected disruptions. The problem is that many companies still rely on outdated, manual processes or scattered tools to manage these risks. This makes it difficult to track potential threats, respond quickly, and make informed decisions.

Without a structured system in place, organizations struggle to identify risks in time, assess their impact, and take the right actions to minimize damage. The lack of centralized risk monitoring makes it difficult for stakeholders to make informed decisions. As a result, businesses can face unnecessary financial losses, operational delays, and reputational harm.

This Risk Management System will be designed to solve that problem by providing a centralized platform where organisations can easily track, assess, and mitigate risks in real time. By simplifying tasks and giving clear information, the system helps companies spot risks early, stay prepared, and make better decisions.

## Individual Scope
This project focuses on the feasibility of building an end-to-end risk management system for an organization, addressing both technical and practical challenges. The system is feasible because risk management is a crucial part of any business operation, especially in large organizations. The technologies (backend APIs, databases, user interfaces) will be well-established, and the project will be completed within the proposed timeline.

The system will involve:
- Risk identification
- Risk assessment (probability, impact)
- Risk mitigation planning
- Monitoring and tracking of risks over time
