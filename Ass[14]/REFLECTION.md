# Reflection – Open Source Collaboration

## Improvements Made
After preparing the RMS repo for contributors, I realized how important it is to have clear documentation. Adding `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and issue labels helped organize the project and made it much more understandable for others. Based on feedback, I also clarified the API routes in the README and added a few more test cases to improve coverage.

## Onboarding Challenges
One challenge was making sure new contributors understood how to set up the project. I had to update the README and include dependency instructions that were obvious to me but not to others. Labeling meaningful issues was also tricky—I had to break down bigger problems into smaller, approachable pieces.

## Lessons Learned
I learned that open-source work is more than just code. It’s about creating a space where others can collaborate easily. Tools like GitHub Actions, labels, and PR workflows are vital for this. I now appreciate the discipline required for good documentation and the joy of seeing others contribute to my work.

It’s not just a project—it’s a community effort.
