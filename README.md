# üìä Risk Management System

## üßæ Project Overview

The **Risk Management System (RMS)** is a full-stack solution designed to allow organizations to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks in real time. Built using Agile methodologies, the system has evolved through structured assignments that focused on key aspects of software development: from requirements gathering to clean architecture, testing, DevOps integration, and CI/CD automation.

## Domain: 
The system falls under the domain of **Business Operations,Organisations and Risk Management**, which helps businesses identify, analyze, and respond to potential risks in an organized manner.

## Problem Statement: 
The purpose of this system is to streamline the process of identifying risks within an organization and developing mitigation plans for these risks. The system will help companies respond quickly to risks, reduce uncertainties, and minimize financial losses.
