# System Specification Document
## Project Title: 
Risk Management System

## Domain: 
The system falls under the domain of **Business Operations and Risk Management**, which helps businesses identify, analyze, and respond to potential risks in an organized manner.

## Problem Statement: 
The purpose of this system is to streamline the process of identifying risks within an organization and developing mitigation plans for these risks. The system will help companies respond quickly to risks, reduce uncertainties, and minimize financial losses.

## Individual Scope: 
This project focuses on the feasibility of building an end-to-end risk management system for an organization, addressing both technical and practical challenges. The system will involve:
- Risk identification
- Risk assessment (probability, impact)
- Risk mitigation planning
- Monitoring and tracking of risks over time

### Feasibility Justification:
The system is feasible because risk management is a crucial part of any business operation, especially in large organizations. The technologies required (backend APIs, databases, user interfaces) are well-established, and the project can be completed within the proposed timeline.
