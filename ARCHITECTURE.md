## Project Title
Risk Management System
## Domain
Risk Management in Organisations
# Intruduction
Risk management is a critical function for organisations and businesses across various industries. They include finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and IT. Organizations constantly face potential threats, such as financial losses, security breaches, regulatory non-compliance, operational failures, and reputational damage. Without a structured approach in organisations to identifying and addressing these risks, businesses become vulnerable to unexpected disruptions that can impact growth and stability.

A Risk Management System provides organizations with a centralized platform to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks effectively. By leveraging technology, businesses can transition from reactive risk management to a proactive, data-driven approach. This system ensures that potential threats are recognized early, appropriate mitigation strategies are developed, and ongoing monitoring keeps risks under control.

The system will support organizations in:
- Identifying risks across various departments and operations.
- Assessing risks based on probability and potential impact.
- Developing mitigation plans to minimize the consequences of risks.
- Tracking risks over time and ensuring continuous monitoring.
  
## Problem Statement
Many organization faces risks like its financial losses, cyber security threats, compliance issues, or unexpected disruptions. The problem is that many companies still rely on outdated, manual processes or scattered tools to manage these risks. This makes it difficult to track potential threats, respond quickly, and make informed decisions.

Without a structured system in place, organizations struggle to identify risks in time, assess their impact, and take the right actions to minimize damage. The lack of centralized risk monitoring makes it difficult for stakeholders to make informed decisions. As a result, businesses can face unnecessary financial losses, operational delays, and reputational harm.

This Risk Management System will be designed to solve that problem by providing a centralized platform where organisations can easily track, assess, and mitigate risks in real time. By simplifying tasks and giving clear information, the system helps companies spot risks early, stay prepared, and make better decisions.

## Individual Scope
The architecture of the Risk Management System is designed to ensure a structured and scalable approach to risk identification, assessment, and mitigation. This document provides a detailed breakdown of the key system components, from the user interface to backend services, ensuring seamless integration and efficient risk management.

The scope of the architecture includes:
-	User Interface (UI):
	- A web-based dashboard for risk monitoring and management.
  - Intuitive UI for users to log risks, assess impact, and track mitigation efforts.
  - Role-based access control (e.g., risk managers, employees, administrators).
- Backend Services (API Layer):
o	RESTful API for handling risk data, including risk identification, assessment, and mitigation workflows.
o	Authentication and authorization mechanisms (JWT-based or OAuth).
o	Business logic implementation for risk scoring, categorization, and reporting.
- Database Layer:
o	Relational database (MySQL) for storing risk records, mitigation plans, and user data.
o	Schema design optimized for scalability and quick retrieval of risk data.
-	Notification & Reporting Module:
o	Automated alerts for high-priority risks.
o	Risk reports and analytics dashboard for management decision-making.
o	Export options (PDF, CSV) for compliance and auditing purposes.
- Security & Compliance:
o	Data encryption and secure API communication.
o	Compliance with industry standards (ISO 31000, GDPR, etc.).
- Deployment & Scalability:
o	Cloud-based deployment on AWS/Azure for high availability and scalability.
o	CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
